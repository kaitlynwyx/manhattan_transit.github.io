## Analysis and Summaries  

Some major findings are worth pointing out from the velocity heatmap.   

#### ***Taxi vs Bike***   
  
From the heat map, we found that the mean velocity of taking taxi is still faster compared to riding a bike overall. However, riding bikes during rush hour in Manhattan is competitive to take a taxi while only travelling across the nearby taxi zones in Midtown. That means cabs will not save you more time when you only cycle between midtown but cost you more based on marketing price, especially for shorter trips. The usage of both bikes and cabs are of more need during daytime and become less after sunset which follows our travel habit. Moreover, people would be more likely to take a taxi to travel across more taxi zone areas compared to riding bikes.   
  
#### ***The Velocity of Taxi Zones***  
  
As we know the midtown of Manhattan is known for its bustling and busy traffic, the mean velocity in midtown is significantly slower compared to neighborhoods in Uppertown and Downtown. Moreover, the velocity in Uppertown and Randalls Island would be even quicker. We notice that the traffic on Randalls Island usually performs better, and this might because of the lower population density. We also known from the web that this is a parkland island and there is no residential housing for the general public except for some public facilities. And the specific traffic time would be more dependent on where you are coming from and where you are going to.
  
What is worth emphasizing here is that the more taxi zones that you cross, the faster velocity that we might obtain no matter where our pick up location is and what our transport is. We guess it might be because of the longer travel distance we have, the drivers or riders would more likely to choose the high way, the road with low traffic and avoid traffic lights.
