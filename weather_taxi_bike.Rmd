The trends for people choose to travel outside are generally similar no matter using bikes or cabs. But it exists a more significant drop for choosing taxi during the June and less people ride bikes during Dec and Feb. After analyzing the possible casuals, June is the month for students within NYU start their Summer Vacations. So the traffic pressure has a visualized decrease with more people still live in NYU. And for people, especially students, who still live in NYU, they do not have the need to commute in a hurry. Also, with the temperature getting colder and colder, people will prefer more stay at home comparing to traveling and less possibility for them to riding bikes outside. The temperature of the weather could be a confounder to transport choice and month model, but not for special month June. 


```{r wind speed(mm) vs velocity, message=FALSE}
# wind speed (mm) vs velocity
weather_transport_df %>% 
  group_by(type, awnd) %>% 
  summarize(v_mean = mean(velocity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = awnd/10, y = v_mean, group = type, colour = type)) + 
    geom_point(aes(colour = type)) +
    geom_smooth(method = lm) +
    labs(title = "Velocity vs Wind Speed",
           x = "Wind Speed (m/s)", 
          y = "Mean Velocity (m/s)") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
  
It's interesting to find out the truth that following by the increasing of wind speed, a linear regression model could be explored between the velocity of bike riders and wind speed and velocity of bikes is increasing as well. While at the same time, wind speed does no influence to taxi drivers.

      labs(title = "Transport Choice vs Precipitation", 
           x = "Precipitation (mm)",

Velocity could be regarded as one parameter to judge the flow of a transportation. Obviously from the plots showing the connection between the velocity and the mode of transport, the velocity of taxi are faster to bike on average. And the light to moderate rain (<30 mm), precipitation seems have no impact to the velocity, especially while taking a look at bike data. That might because though raining will make road more slippery, it also has washing effect to environment and other effects. The combination of all effects make velocity nearly stay the same. Moreover, the more amount of rain is, the slower the traffic it would be, the less people would choose to travel and it is more likely to choose taxi while weather condition getting even worse compared to riding. That might because a heavy rain might possibly affect drivers and riders visibility, thus decreases the vehicle speed and affects travel choice.

The distribution and trends of travel choice among taxi and bikes are distint different. People tend to choose taxi travel plan while in relatively low temperature and will change to bike preference when there is significant increase in temperature. People have more possibility to stay home when meet with extreme high temperature. It could be concluded that people are more willing to travel outside under the moderate temperature, the higher, lower or even extreme temperature the weather is, the less potential likelihood that people will go outside and use the transport. It also comes an interesting phenomenon that taxi tends to run faster and bike runs slower with the temperature increase. The faster of the taxi could because of the decrease of the traffic pressure and the better road condition. At the same time, snow effect makes riders drive quicker for getting avoid of staying outside and keep warm.
