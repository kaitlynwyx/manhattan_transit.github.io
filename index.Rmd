## __Introduction__
Have you ever been stuck in the NYC subway with no signal on? In a car that does not move at all? Have you ever noticed any citibike station when you're wandering on the street? Do you ever wonder which transportation is the best time-saving option in Manhattan? If yes, then you are at the right place!

Welcome to our project, and let us present to you our findings on the fastest way to get around in Manhattan and guide you through our interactive map where you can estimate travel time using each transportation at different time periods of the year/day with just several clicks!

## __Motivation__ 
The initial idea of the project arose when we decided to give ourselves a little break after struggling for so long on deciding what project to do. We started chitchatting, and through our conversation, we realized that we all commute to school via different transportation. We have one person driving, one taking the subway, one riding citibike and two taking the bus. As we were complaining about the transportation system and bad traffic in the city, we all agreed on doing a project that could help people choose the most time-saving and cost-effective transportation in Manhattan. Inspired by the paper _Hail a cab or ride a bike? A travel time comparison of taxi and bicycle-sharing systems in New York City_, we are interested in whether bicycles can compete with other transportation in terms of travel time in Manhattan in 2020 to 2021 specifically.
